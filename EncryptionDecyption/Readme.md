# **Title:** Text Encryption/Decryption Tool

## **Description:**

***This is a Python program that provides a simple and user-friendly tool for encrypting and decrypting text messages. It utilizes the Caesar Cipher for encryption, which shifts letters by a specified value.***

***Features:***

* ***Encrypts and decrypts text messages using Caesar Cipher.***
* ***User-friendly interface with Tkinter for easy interaction.***
* ***Prompts for choosing between encryption and decryption tasks.***
* ***Allows entering a secret message for encryption or decryption.***
* ***Asks for a shift value (1-25) for Caesar Cipher.***
* ***Displays the encrypted or decrypted message in a text box.***
* ***Error handling for invalid input (empty message or invalid shift value).***

***Requirements:***

* ***Python 3.x***
* ***Tkinter library (usually pre-installed with Python)***

***Installation:***

1. ***Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.***
2. ***No additional installation is required for Tkinter as it's usually included with Python.***

***Usage:***

1. ***Save the Python script (e.g.,`text_encrypt_decrypt.py`) in a desired location.***
2. ***Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.***
3. ***Run the program using the following command:***

```
python text_encrypt_decrypt.py
```

4. ***The program will launch a graphical window.***
5. ***Choose "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" from the Task option.***
6. ***Enter the message you want to encrypt/decrypt in the Message entry box.***
7. ***Enter a shift value between 1 and 25 for Caesar Cipher (optional: higher values provide stronger encryption but make decryption trickier).***
8. ***Click the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button based on your chosen task.***
9. ***The encrypted/decrypted message will be displayed in the result text box.***

***Example:***

1. ***You want to encrypt the message "This is a secret message" with a shift value of 3.***
2. ***Run the program and choose "Encrypt" as the task.***
3. ***Enter "This is a secret message" in the Message box.***
4. ***Enter 3 as the shift value.***
5. ***Click the "Encrypt" button.***
6. ***The encrypted message "Wkhuh lv d uhdo olvwhuv" will be displayed in the result box.***

***Additional Notes:***

* ***Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique and can be easily broken with brute-force methods.***
* ***For stronger encryption, consider using more robust algorithms like AES or RSA.***
* ***This program is for educational purposes and should not be used for highly sensitive information.***

***Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific needs and preferences.***
